                <h2>Last time</h2>
                <p>In the last meeting we discussed some very <i><b>important</b></i> points that were <em>incredibly</em> important. However There were somethings that we were unable to get to which were also very <strong>important</strong>.</p>
                
                <h2>This time</h2>
                <p>Alright, now that we have covered all the important things that we missed from last meeting, we can move on to what we need to cover in this meeting: Standups</p>

                    <summary>Solved World hunger</summary>
                    <p>This week I was able to solve world hunger by creating by doing very Sciencey things with food. I actually found that when we eat food, it disappears. This gave me an idea. What if we dont eat food? I tried it and the food did not disappear. With this breakthrough I issued an order to stop everyone from eating food so now we have enough food for everyone.</p>

                    <summary>Solved Homelessness</summary>
                    <p>This week I was able to solve the homeless crisis around the world. So we found that 100% of the homeless people around the world are homeless because they dont have a home. To solve this problem we realized that these homeless people might not know that they are homeless because they dont have a home. I recently issued an order to all homeless people, asking them to immediately find a home. Thus solving the crisis</p>

                    <summary>Solved Poverty</summary>
                    <p>This week I was able to solve poverty. <strong>One-Hundred Percent</strong> of poor people are poor because they don't make enough money. Because of this I issued an order telling these people to go and make more money.</p>

                <h3>Closing Summary</h3>
                <p>This week the team did some very good work solving minor problems all around the world. Next week we will move on to the bigger issues like finding remotes in couches and keys that fall into sewers. Billy will no longer be a part of the team as he has shown no drive or motivation to do the work asked of him</p>
